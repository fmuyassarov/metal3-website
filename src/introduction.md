Metal³ project (pronounced: Metal Kubed) exists to provide components
that allow you to do bare metal host management for Kubernetes. Metal³
works as a Kubernetes application, meaning it runs on Kubernetes and is
managed through Kubernetes interfaces.

Metal³ is one of the providers for the Kubernetes sub-project Cluster
API and is focused on providing Kubernetes native APIs to manage
Kubernetes clusters in a bare metal environment.
